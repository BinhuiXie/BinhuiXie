### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a researcher in computer vision and machine learning. My current interests are in *transfer learning* and *data-efficient learning* (particularly domain adaptation, active learning) and *self-supervised learning* across visual tasks and domains. 

See my [HomePage](https://binhuixie.github.io/) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cbVMMCwAAAAJ) for more about me and my research. :)
